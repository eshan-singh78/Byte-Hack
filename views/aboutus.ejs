    <h2>Who we are?</h2>
    <p>
      We are a group of people who are trying to bring the CTF (Capture The Flag) event prominently in India as a trend among students and enthusiasts. We focus on creating an experience rather than just a puzzle-solving competition.
    </p>

    <h2>What we do?</h2>
    <p>
      We assist colleges and other open CTF organizers by creating a series of puzzles, problems, vulnerable machines, and more. Additionally, we manage the submission and digital/tech aspects of event organization. Our scenarios are created by in-house brains that are deeply involved in scrapping the web for daily updates to keep our events aligned with technological advancements.
    </p>

    <h2>Our aim?</h2>
    <p>
      Our goal is simple: to make CTF a trend not only among cybersecurity enthusiasts but also among everyone connected to the tech industry!
